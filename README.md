# FizzBuzz ReadMe

### Author: Richard Kellermeyer

##### Concerns:

The exercise did take me longer than expected, and I apologize for that.
I'm hoping that the code quality is acceptable to your company's standards.

I really appreciate the opportunity to test with your team. If given the chance, I really feel like I could be an asset, despite the time it took to complete this exercise.

Even if the code is not up to your standards, please let me know how I could have improved, and any other advice you feel you would like to give.

Again, I really appreciate the opportunity that you have extended to me, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

##### Notes:

* Took advice from Amir and extracted the FizzBuzz logic into a module

* Refactored fizzer_buzzer module logic to execute faster

* Added controller test for ensuring an Integer is passed to the controller in params

* Specs cover controller and lib/module

* Database can be created by running rails db:setup, but it is NOT necessary
